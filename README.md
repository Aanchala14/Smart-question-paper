# Centroid and area of contours in image

Use OpenCV to detect contours in an image, calculate the centroid and area of every contour, and output the results.

## Overview

The script performs the following tasks:
1. Loads a grayscale image.
2. Applies Gaussian blur to reduce noise.
3. Applies binary thresholding to create a binary image.
4. Detects contours in the binary image.
5. Calculates the centroid and area for each detected contour.
6. Visualizes the contours and centroids on the original image.

## Requirements

- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
